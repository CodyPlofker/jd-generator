# Hook Principles

What makes a hook work. This document captures the core principles that separate great hooks from mediocre ones.

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Curiosity Gap
Create a gap between what the viewer knows and what they want to know. The hook promises information that satisfies an itch.

### 2. Open Loops
Start something that demands completion. The brain naturally wants to close loops - use this to keep viewers watching.

### 3. Pattern Interrupt
Break expectations. Say something unexpected that makes the viewer stop scrolling and pay attention.

### 4. Specificity
Vague hooks feel generic. Specific details (numbers, names, scenarios) feel real and credible.

### 5. Emotional Trigger
Tap into a feeling: frustration, desire, fear of missing out, validation, surprise.

### 6. Implied Transformation
Suggest that watching will change something for the viewer - they'll learn, feel, or gain something.

## What to Avoid

- Starting slow or with unnecessary context
- Being predictable
- Overselling or clickbait that doesn't deliver
- Generic statements that could apply to anything
- Burying the interesting part

## Channel Considerations

### Paid Ads
- Must work without sound (first frame matters)
- Viewer is interrupting their feed - earn attention fast
- Can be more direct about product/benefit

### Organic
- Feels native to platform
- Often more conversational/authentic
- Can build more slowly if pattern interrupt is strong

### Brand POV vs Creator POV
- **Brand**: Can lean on authority, product knowledge, behind-the-scenes
- **Creator**: Personal story, discovery narrative, "I found this thing"
